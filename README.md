# Jackbox Mockup
As part of my 11th-grade cybersecurity major, I embarked on an exciting end-of-year project. I chose this endeavor because it promised a blend of fun, intrigue, and challenge—something I could create and share with my friends.

This project not only satisfies academic requirements but also serves as an excellent addition to job interviews and resumes. It delves into various facets of networking and web development, showcasing my profound understanding of web technologies and socket networking.

## How It Works

1.  **Main Game Program**:
    
    -   Open the main game program on a shared computer visible to all players.
    -   The main menu will display all available mini-games.
2.  **Launching a Mini-Game**:
    
    -   Choose a mini-game from the menu.
    -   As you open a mini-game, a  **backend local HTTP server**  starts running.
    -   The server’s IP address will be shown on the screen.
3.  **Playing the Game**:
    
    -   Each player opens the displayed IP address in their preferred web browser.
    -   The game website hosted by the local server will load.
    -   Now, the players can dive into the mini-game and start playing!
